# Unified Backend

1. It supports a suite of products that I have prototyped over the last 3 months in Farcaster ecosystem.
2. Using FC Auth, you can experience multiple products through this single repo.

## Reason:

I am fed up of deploying multiple Vercel apps and their timeouts.
I need to run Kafka queues which require a backend server listening to the queue.
